# Yanna - chatGPT's younger sibling
[Yanna](https://yanna.vercel.app/) is an AI chatbot built by integrating the chatGPT API from OpenAI.

Here are some tips to take note:
- Yanna may take some few seconds to respond while thinking of the best answer to provide to you.
- Apart from text queries, other questions involving requests like `generating code` and `tables` are often answered in a raw-format display.
