# Yanna - an OpenAI API Prototype.
Yanna is an AI chatbot built by integrating the Codex chatGPT API model from OpenAI.

Here are some tips to keep in mind:
- Yanna may take some few seconds to respond while thinking of the best answer to provide to you.
- Apart from text queries, other questions involving requests like `generating code` and `tables` are often answered in a raw-format display.


For more information on the OpenAI API utility, please take a look into this [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction).
